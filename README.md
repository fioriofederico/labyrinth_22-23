## How to run unittest
To run unittest you can execute the TestMaze.py under test directory to run all test like:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python TestMaze.py
```
Or you can run directly the module you want to test, if the module contains a main with doctest import, with the following command:
```python
# maze.py

# ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

```console
foo@bar:~$ python maze.py -v

```
